OBJECTIVE
Kernel and system level software design and development for networking and embedded systems


WORK EXPERIENCE
Viscore Technologies, Inc Ottawa, ON, Canada
Lead R&D engineer on network architecture, software, and hardware Sept. 2014 - Dec. 2016
· Architected the integration and interface solution of embedding our own link-layer protocol---HEDA---in the Linux networking system.
· Designed and implementing software modules of HEDA in C at the kernel device driver level.
· Designed and implemented a user-space token-passing protocol in C to demonstrate burst data transmission between two hosts connected through an optical coupler.
· Developed in-depth knowledge of NIC hardware data plane and control plane architecture. Disabled link fault signaling at the physical layer to allow burst-mode transmission.

Source Technologies International, Ltd. Ottawa, ON, Canada
Consulting software engineer Jun. 2014 - Aug. 2014
· Developed a mobile scenario manager app---a commercial product for iPhone iOS---in 1.5 months with both Objective-C and iOS programming learned from scratch.
· Developed an Android counterpart fulfilling the same requirements.


R&D EXPERIENCE
Carleton University Ottawa, ON, Canada
Researcher Jun. 2011 - Aug. 2014
· Proposed POXN---a datacenter network architecture using passive optical devices. Designed HEDA---a distributed link-layer communication protocol. Granted OCE (Ontario Centres of Excellence) TalentEdge fellowship for research commercialization.
· Developed an availability model for Valiant load balancing networks over optical networks. Honored as a runner-up of the 2013 Fabio Neri Best Paper Award (4 papers out of year 2013).

NEC Laboratories America, Inc. Princeton, NJ, USA
Visiting researcher, Dept. of optical networking Jan. 2011 - Feb. 2011
· Setup Xen 4.0.1 pv-ops Ubuntu 10.10 through kernel conﬁguration & building.
· Demonstrated VM live migration between two physical hosts connected by a gigabit switch.
