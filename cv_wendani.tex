%Wenda Ni received the B.E. degree (with excellency) in electronic
%science and technology in 2005 from Tsinghua University, P. R.
%China, where he is currently working towards the Ph.D. degree with
%the Department of Electronic Engineering.
%
%From Feb. 2005 to July 2010, he is a research assistant with the
%Laboratory of Optical Networking and Microwave Photonics at Tsinghua
%University, where he is involved in several research projects. From
%Oct. 2008 to Mar. 2009, being granted the DAAD research fellowship,
%he is a visiting student with the network design and modeling group,
%Department of Photonic Networks and Systems (PN),
%Fraunhofer-Institute for Telecommunications,
%Heinrich-Hertz-Institut, Berlin, Germany, under the supervision of
%Dr. Erwin Patzak. His research interests include network design,
%operations and management with a focus on survivability, service
