career path

more than software engineer

Research career
We pursue excellent research. Our works are internationally acclaimed
Trained me to learn new skills fast, and the mindset of being persistent and not being afraid to take challenging problems
Kernel as an insurmountable animal; the right skills to master it
That really works: a strong sense of asking the right question, and finding the right answer

shift to industry is never easy in the first place
I am very thankful to my current company that opens the industry door for me. I work very hard to earn this.
Five years ago, I left US with not that much to show. Thanks for inviting me back to restart my journey here.
This is really a recognition of my hard work. This is what I have been striving for over the past five years. 
I cherish this opportunity a lot.
